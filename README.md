<li>MY PORTFOLIO</li>
-It entails a brief description of who I am,what i do and what i have done in the past few years.I am the author of this project.
I am motivated to put my portfolio out in the public so that i get noticed,i believe i have what it takes to make an impact in the future technological advances.
some of the coding styles and languages used iclude and not limited to;html,css(styling),bootstrap(styling effects),the use of linux terminal,virtual studio code,atom editor.
One major thing that i think makes my project stand out is the fact that i have utilized most styling effects for both background color animation and vivid description of what i do.
Apparently i am the only contributor of the project as of now but am open to code contribution via dreamviewer
